# Open Tabs Finder | Alfred Workflow

This is a custom Alfred Workflow that streamlines the process of searching for and opening folders on your macOS system.

## Key Features

- **Quick Search**: Simply type "ot" (short for "Open Tab") into the Alfred search bar and start typing the name of the folder you're looking for. The workflow will automatically search for matches as you type.
- **Open in Finder Tabs**: When you find the folder you want to open, press "Enter," and the workflow will open the folder in a new Finder tab. This allows you to keep your workspace organized and access your projects quickly.

## How to Use
1. [Download](https://github.com/vanstrouble/opentab-alfred-workflow/releases/download/1.0.0/OpenTabs.alfredworkflow) the workflow file.
2. Open the downloaded .alfredworkflow file with Alfred. Alfred will guide you through the installation of the workflow.
3. That's it! You can now start searching for and opening folders quickly from Alfred.
